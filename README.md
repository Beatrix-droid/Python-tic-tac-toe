# Python-tic-tac-toe
a python version of tic tac toe
A simple beginner project on the python version of the tic tac toe game

This was my take, on a simple game created to practice some python logic.

How to play:
the start starts first Each square in the 3 x3 grid is labeled by its row and column positions.
Tthe squares are thus labeled like entries of a matrix. The first square (on teh ulper left corner) will thus be the square in position 1 1
To draw on a particular square enter the Row number followed by the columnb number you wish to draw on.
The astersik (representing the naughts) starts first, with the crosses coming second.


Unit tests for this project  wlll be added after I have studied the unit testing module in depth.
